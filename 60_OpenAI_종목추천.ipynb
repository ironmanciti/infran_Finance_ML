      "1. **GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**:\n",
      "   - **재무적 강점**: GOOG는 2024년 기준으로 350억 달러 이상의 총 수익을 기록하였고, 순이익 역시 100억 달러가 넘습니다. EBITDA는 1,353억 달러로 매우 양호한 수준입니다.\n",
      "   - **자본 구조**: 총 부채가 254억 달러로 상대적으로 낮아 재무 건전성이 뛰어납니다. 현금 및 단기 투자도 약 234억 달러를 보유하고 있어 유동성 문제에서 자유롭습니다.\n",
      "   - **수익 성장**: GOOG의 EPS(주당 순이익)가 계속 증가하고 있으며, 향후에도 광고 매출 등에서 성장 여지가 큽니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AMZN (Amazon.com Inc.)**:\n",
      "   - **전국적인 시장 점유율**: AMZN은 전자상거래 및 클라우드 서비스 사업에서 세계적인 리더입니다. 2024년 총 매출이 638억 달러에 달하며, 강력한 시장 점유율을 유지하고 있습니다.\n",
      "   - **자유 현금 흐름**: AMZN은 올해 흑자를 내고 있으며, 자산을 지속적으로 늘려가는 추세입니다. 자유 현금 흐름이 개선되고 있어 장기적으로 안정적인 성장을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n",
      "   - **다양한 사업모델**: Amazon은 전자상거래 외에도 AWS(아마존 웹 서비스) 등 다양한 분야에서도 수익을 창출하고 있어 관련 시장의 성장 혜택을 누릴 가능성이 높은 기업입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "**결론**: GOOG는 안정적인 수익성과 탄탄한 재무 구조를 갖추고 있어, 안정적 수익을 추구하는 투자자에게 유망합니다. AMZN은 전 세계적인 시장 점유율과 다양한 사업 모델 덕분에 성장 가능성이 커, 성장주를 선호하는 투자자에게 적합합니다. 이러한 이유로 이 두 종목을 추천드립니다.\n"
